# Gsoc-22-Microtask
This is Microtask for Gsoc-22 with Chaoss Organization

## Idea: [Build Knowledge Base application on CHAOSS](https://github.com/Akshaya101/community/blob/main/GSoC-Ideas.md#idea-build-knowledgebase-application-on-chaoss-website)

## Microtask 1:

Research Knowledge Base plugins for WordPress

After my research, I found 2 Knowledge Base plugins which would complement the current state of CHAOSS Website.
These plugins are:

- [Echo Knowledge Base ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/echo-knowledge-base/)
- [BetterDocs](https://betterdocs.co/docs/wordpress/)

## Microtask 2:

Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

## Microtask 3:

Implement two knowledgebase plugins (free versions) on your WordPress site. If you are recommending a plugin that costs money, please reach out to a mentor to discuss.
